- Anonymous chunks whose names are not saved by the object writer.
- 32-bit coding for larger-pointered architecture versions.
- HOFDump mode for HARPTool/HOFTool
- Make operation information tables into functions of Instruction, if possible.
- Anonymous assigned values in the assembler.
- References (pointers) as .word directive contents in the assembler.
- .byte directive for assembler.
  - Make assembler writer capable of writing binary data without making size of
    output a multiple of word size. Useful in pre-assembled code.
- Instruction validation before encoding.
- Make readError in obj.cpp throw something instead of printing the whine and
  exiting.
- Limit checking for byte/word encoders (e.g. 255 pRegs, 256 regs for byte)
- Eliminate the tmp_buf nonsense from the chunk encoder.
- Loosen arch restrictions imposed for interoperability.
