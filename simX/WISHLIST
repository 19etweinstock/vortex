- Anonymous chunks whose names are not saved by the object writer.
- 32-bit instruction encoding for larger-pointered architecture versions.
- HOFDump mode for HARPTool/HOFTool
- Make operation information tables into member functions of Instruction, if
  possible.
- Anonymous assigned values in the assembler.
- References (pointers) as .word directive contents in the assembler.
- Instruction validation before encoding.
- Make readError in obj.cpp throw something instead of printing a message and
  exiting.
- Limit checking for byte/word encoders (e.g. 255 pRegs, 256 regs for byte)
- Eliminate the tmp_buf nonsense from the chunk encoder.
- Loosen arch restrictions imposed for interoperability (the number of lanes is
  typically unimportant)
