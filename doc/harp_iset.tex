\section*{Introduction}
HARP is two things, a multi-year Heterogeneous Architecture Research Project, and an implementation of a specific Heterogeneous Architecture Research Prototype.
It is for the latter that the HARP instruction set architectures have been created.
This is a space of SIMT(GPU) oriented RISC-like instruction sets with the following properties:

\begin{itemize}
  \item{Full predication}
  \item{Assembly language level compatibility}
  \item{SIM[DT] parallelism}
  \item{Little endianness}
  \item{8-bit byte size}
  \item{Customizability}
\end{itemize}

The customizability of the HARP ISAs is illustrated by facts missing from this list of features.
The data path width, instruction encodings, number of registers (general purpose and predicate) are all left up to the implementation.
Harptool; the HARP assembler, linker, emulator, and disassembler, is passed information about the ISA through an architecture identifier string, or \texttt{ArchID}.
An \texttt{ArchID} uniquely identifies a HARP ISA.

\section{Architecture Identifier String (\texttt{ArchID})}
The best way to understand the multifaceted parameterizablity of the HARP ISAs is to study the architecture identifier strings used to uniquely identify a single HARP instruction set architecture.
We'll start by breaking down Harptool's default \texttt{ArchID}: \texttt{8w32/32/8}:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{rl}
\textbf{Field}&\textbf{Meaning}\\
\hline
\texttt{8} &8-byte (64-bit) registers and addresses\\
\texttt{w} &Word-based (64-bit) fixed-width instruction encoding\\
\texttt{32}&32 general-purpose registers per lane\\
\texttt{32}&32 predicate registers per lane\\
\texttt{8} &8 SIMD lanes\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

All ArchIDs have a similar format, although the SIMD lanes field can be omitted, as object files are still fully compatible even if the number of lanes changes. 

\section{HarpTool}
The assembler/linker/emulator/disassembler program for HARP is called HarpTool.
It is a multiple-function executable, its function selected with the first command line argument.
When run with no command line arugments the HarpTool executable prints a help message explaining the available command line arguments.

All of the HARP utilities can take an archID as a command line parameter.
If none is provided, a default will be assumed.

\subsection{Assembler}
The assembler converts assembly files to HOF, the Harp Object Format.

\subsection{Linker}
The linker combines HOF files and produces raw RAM images for use by the emulator.
An intended future use is the conversion of multiple HOF files to statically-linked HOF executables.

%\subsection{Emulator}
%The emulator emulates a HARP system.
%It can be provided with a 

\subsection{Disassembler}
The disassembler is used to convert HOF files to equivalent assembly files.
One of its intended uses is the conversion of HOF object files between different HARP ISAs, say from 8w32/32 to 8b32/32.

\subsection{Test Programs}
In the \texttt{harptool/test} directory there is a set of test programs.
The makefile in this directory assembles, links, and emulates them, placing the output in plain text files.

\subsubsection{\texttt{hello.s}}
The simplest example prints a message and exits.

\subsubsection{\texttt{2thread.s}}
\texttt{2thread} performs a vector addition across two threads.

\subsubsection{\texttt{sieve.s}}
\texttt{sieve} performs the Sieve of Eratosthenes in a single thread and prints the results, including the count of total prime numbers found.

\section{Instruction Encoding}
There are two currently-supported types of instruction encoding, but they all share a similar basic structure.
The opcodes and types of fields required by each instruction are identical, differentiated only by the number of bits available for each type of field and the way predication is specified.

\subsection{Argument Classes}
Instructions can be broadly categorized by the types of arguments they require.
The bit fields in the instruction encodings depend heavily on this quality.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|l}

\texttt{AC\_1REG}    &1 reg in             &\texttt{jmpr   \%r2}            \\
\texttt{AC\_3IMMSRC} &2 GPRs in, 1 imm. in &\texttt{st     \%r1, \%r2, \#10;}\\
\texttt{AC\_PREG\_REG}&GPR in, pred. reg. out &\texttt{iszero @p0, \%r3;}    \\
\texttt{AC\_2PREG}   &2 pred. regs, 1 in, 1 out&\texttt{notp   @p0, @p0;}    \\

\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Word Encoding}

Word-based instruction encodings all share the initial fields:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The most-significant bit is 1 if the instruction is predicated and 0 otherwise.
  \item The next $log_2(\mathrm{\#pred\_regs})$ specify the predicate register.
  \item The next 6 bits are used for the opcode.
\end{itemize}

After this, the operands of the instruction are ordered corresponding to their ordering in the assembly language, sized according to the following rules:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Register operands are $log_2(\mathrm{\#GPRs})$ bits long, or just enough bits to uniquely identify a register.
  \item Predicate register operands are $log_2(\mathrm{\#pred\_regs})$ bits long, or just enough bits to uniquely identify a predicate register.
  \item Immediate fields are always the last field and occupy the remaining bits of the instruction. All immediate fields are sign extended to the length of a machine word.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{fig/word_enc}
\end{center}

\subsection{Byte Encoding}
In the byte encoding, each field of the instruction (predicate, opcode, operands) occupies a byte, with the exception of immediates, which occupy an unaligned word.
All instructions have a predicate and opcode byte.
The predicate byte is all ones if the instruction is not predicated; oterwise the predicate byte contains the predicate register number used to predicate the instruction.
Just like the word-based instruction encoding, registers appear in the same order as the assembly language, destination-first.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{fig/byte_enc}
\end{center}

\section{Assembly Language}
The assembly language is fairly easy to pick up from the HarpTools examples. It is RISC-like, and written destination register first (in this it differs from Unix assembly syntax).
Registers names are prefixed with the percent sign (\%) and predicate register names with the at symbol (@).
Predicated instructions are prefixed with the predicate register name and a question mark:
\begin{verbatim}
  @p0 ? addi %r7, %r1, #1
\end{verbatim}
A small set of directives is provided to express non-instruction data:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cl}
\textbf{Directive}&\textbf{Use}\\
\hline
\texttt{.align 256}    &Align next symbol to a multiple of 256 bytes.\\
\texttt{.word 0x1234}  &Insert a word with the value \texttt{0x1234}.\\
\texttt{.byte 0xff}    &Insert a byte with the value \texttt{0xff}.\\
\texttt{.def SYM 123}  &Replace SYM with 123 in immediate operands.\\
\texttt{.entry}        &Make the next label the HOF executable entry point.\\
\texttt{.global}       &Give the next label global (external) linkage.\\
\texttt{.perm rw}      &Set HOF permissions of the next label to read/write.\\
\texttt{.string "Str"} &Create a null terminated string.\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{tabular}{cl}
\textbf{Instruction}&\textbf{Description}\\
\hline

\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\section{Interrupts}
The HARP interrupt mechanism is simple.
For SIMD lane 0, there is a shadow register file, program counter, and active lane count.
When an interrupt occurs, the state of lane zero is saved into these shadow registers, and execution resumes at the kernel entry point.
The type of interrupt is specified by the value placed in register 0 at this time, according to the following table:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cl}
\textbf{Number}&\textbf{Description}\\
\hline
0    &Trap (user-generated interrupt)\\
1    &Page fault due to absence from TLB\\
2    &Page fault due to permission violation\\
3    &Invalid/unsupported instruction\\
4    &Divergent branch\\
5    &Numerical domain (divide by zero)\\
6-7&(reserved for future exceptions)\\
8    &Console input\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The first eight interrupt numbers are reserved for internal CPU-generated exceptions, and all of the remaining numbers are free for use by hardware.

\section{Application Binary Interface}
The ABI assumes a set of at least four general purpose registers.
The frame pointer is optional and can be stored on the stack itself if necessary.
The stack pointer and link register, in this order, are always the two highest-numbered registers.
If 8 or more registers are available, the frame pointer may be the register one less than the register number of the stack pointer.

\begin{itemize}
  \item The lower-numbered half of the registers are caller-saved (temporary).
  \item The upper-numbered half are therefore callee-saved.
  \item The callee is responsible for adjusting the stack and frame pointers, if such adjustment is required.
  \item The stack grows toward smaller addresses (subtract to push, add to pop).
  \item Pointer function arguments and numerical arguments that can fit in a single register are passed through temporary registers, starting with register \texttt{\%r0}. If more registers are required than there are temporary registers available, stack space at addresses less than the stack pointer is used.
  \item Record (struct) return values and numerical return values larger than the word size are always passed on the stack. The caller is responsible for allocating the necessary space. The stack pointer at the time of call is a pointer to the returned structure. All other return values are returned in \texttt{\%r0}.
\end{itemize}

\section{SIMD Operation}
The HARP ISAs are inherently SIMD.
In addition to designs with a single set of functional units and architectural registers, designs are allowed that replicate these while retaining a single front-end and memory system.
This allows for multiple threads executing the same stream of instructions to simultaneously occupy multiple ``lanes'' of the processor.
When a predicated control flow instruction occurs without unanimous agreement among predicate registers, a divergent branch has occurred.
The current response to this is to trap to the operating system (interrupt number 4).

%\begin{center}
%\includegraphics{fig/simd_core}
%\end{center}

\subsection{Instructions for SIMD Operation}
The \texttt{clone}, \texttt{jalis}, \texttt{jalrs}, and \texttt{jmprt} instructions form the basis of SIMD context control in the HARP instruction set.
Context is created using \texttt{clone}, the waiting threads are spawned using \texttt{jalrs} or \texttt{jalis}, ``jump-and-link immediate/register and spawn'', and finally the parallel section returns using \texttt{jmprt}, ``jump register and terminate'', best thought of as ``return and terminate.''

There are times when a control flow operation will need to be predicated, going one direction on some lanes and the other direction on other lanes.
For this, the HARP instruction set provides the \texttt{split} and \texttt{join} instructions.
When a predicated \texttt{split} is first encountered, only the lanes for which the \texttt{split}'s predicate are true are allowed to continue.
The other lanes are masked out until the corresponding \texttt{join} is encountered.
The first time \texttt{join} is reached, control flow returns to the instruction following the corresponding \texttt{split} with the set of masked-out lanes complemented.
The second time the same \texttt{join} is reached, control flow falls through and the original lane mask is restored.
A hardware stack is maintained to keep track of nested \texttt{split}s.

\section{Default I/O Devices}
The emulator currently only supports a single I/O device, simple console I/O.
Writing to the address \texttt{0x800...0} (an address with its MSB set and all other bits cleared) causes text to be written to the display.
Input on this console interface causes an interrupt (number 8).
